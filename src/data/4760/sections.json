Drawing from a wide range of scholarship in music studies and other disciplines, it will consider topics such as rhythm and meter, dance, movement, gesture, embodied meaning, embodied cognition, entrainment, electronic dance music, the body and technology, disability studies, feminism, the history of music theory, philosophy, and mind-body dualism. The course will be reading-intensive, culminating in a substantial paper based on independent research. <br/><br/>Graduate students with a particular interest in the topic from Ph.D. programs outside of the Bienen School of Music are welcome. The extent to which the course will engage with technical issues in music theory will vary.

Some such blunders create or escalate conflict, damage relationships, or lead to missed opportunities, suboptimal outcomes, interpersonal violence, or even war. <br/> <br/>Of course, poor decisions spring from countless factors, such as cognitive biases, illusions, mental shortcuts (which social scientists call \"heuristics\"), cultural misunderstandings, or too much or too little deliberation or information.

Managing External conflict (between people); 2. Managing Focus (where and how we direct our attention); or 3. Managing Internal conflict (within a person) This course presents three overlapping domains of theory, knowledge, and practice that can help ameliorate these management problems: 1.

The class gives the student a foundation with which to categorize and evaluate the delivery of any drug targeted for a specific indication."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "PREREQUISITES<br/>Graduate Standing"}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "MINI-SYLLABUS<br/>Drug delivery systems-matrix<br/>Diffusion of drugs in vitro and in vivo<br/>Drug permeability<br/>Properties of drug substances<br/>Barriers to drug diffusion<br/>Oral absorption of drugs<br/>Pharmacokinetics<br/>Drug delivery systems-reservoirs<br/>Formulations, Polymers, and Gels<br/>Prodrugs<br/>Liposomes<br/>Pegylated proteins<br/>Polymeric Prodrugs"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Saltzman; Drug Delivery: Engineering Principles for Drug Therapy. 2001 Oxford University Press."}]}, {"id": "16667", "termId": "4760", "schoolId": "MEAS", "subjectId": "BMD_ENG", "courseId": "495-0", "name": "Special Advanced Topics in Biomedical Engineering", "sectionNumber": "20", "instructors": ["Michael A Marasco", "Mark J Fisher"], "topic": "NUvention:Medical Innovation", "schedules": [{"dow": ["We"], "start": {"hour": 18, "minute": 0}, "end": {"hour": 21, "minute": 0}, "location": "Rubloff Building 175"}], "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "Cross-listed with IEMS 495-0<br/><br/>NUvention Medical is a two term, interdisciplinary course designed to give students the experience of being an innovator and entrepreneur in the world of medical devices and health information technology. Students form teams and each team conceives of or identifies an innovative new product or service that meets an existing market need and develops a prototype and a plan to commercial the product or service. A primary goal of the course is to help students understand and work through the challenges facing a new business in the area of medical technology. Students from Feinberg School of Medicine, McCormick School of Engineering, Pritzker School of Law and Kellogg School of Management will participate in the course. Each team will have at least one student from each school. <br/><br/> In the fall term, student teams will explore unmet market needs, understand market characteristics that are important to investors, conceive of or identify an innovative product with a convincing value proposition and \"pitch\" their idea. In the winter term, the teams will be expected to validate the customer and influential stakeholders, formulate a commercialization plan and develop the appropriate regulatory, intellectual property and reimbursement strategies. These will be incorporated into a comprehensive business plan and an investor presentation. As part of the process each team will also be required to develop and present a viable prototype.

Central to such questions is the place of resistance and its relationship to violence. What are the different ways to resist violence? What does it mean to struggle for self-determination? When does a freedom fighter become terrorist? What forms of resistance might give hope for social change? And should resistance be violent or non-violent?

Cultural Analytics provides you with tools to apply this research to make predictions about the market for cultural goods like music, film, books, and computer games. It explores factors that make prediction hard (e.g., social influence, ICTs, and the new digital economy) and gives you alternatives using the potential of Big Data. Specifically, you will learn how to plot and interpret graphs to measure performance in cultural markets; use Internet search data and Twitter conversations to forecast trends; build, visualize, and explore networks; train machine learning algorithms for prediction; and harness the wisdom of crowds. Additionally, some practical components of the course will teach you how to work with IBM's Watson Analytics, an easy-to-use yet powerful and comprehensive data analysis tool. The course provides core data science and modeling skills as well as \"soft skills\" like problem-solving, communication, and project management.

SDS is an injury-preventive, body-and-mind-integrating approach to voice-and-movement work. It involves doing relaxation-based exercises that explore how the body and voice can work with more power and less tension, with greater fluency and fewer energy-blocking habits. SDS is a \"less is more\" approach to acting training. It relies on understanding that the body has evolved over roughly 3.2 million years to work with efficiency. (\"Efficiency\" = using the least effort to achieve a goal.) It encourages us to consider the difference between how we think our bodies should behave (which can result in working with more effort and less efficiency); and how our bodies want to behave (which can help us work with less effort and more efficiency). How we think the body should work is often based on culturally imposed beliefs about physical activity - beliefs that can be at odds with the way the body wants to work. Beliefs like: \"stand up straight!\"; \"chin up, shoulders back!\" \"no pain, no gain!\"; \"burn those abs and quads!\" So, the exercises in this class involve doing the kind of self-reflective work that put us in touch with how the human body operates when guided by nature-given wisdom. It is this wisdom, for instance, that the great-great-grandad of natural-human-behavior-based acting techniques, Konstantin Stanisalvski, counsels throughout An Actor Prepares - for instance, in the chapter titled \"Relaxation of the Muscles.\" It is the kind of quieter, slower, internal work that lets us take a closer look at those physical (and, therefore, emotional) \"holding patterns\" or \"blocking habits\" that can sometimes make us use either too much muscular tension or too much psychological tension. Learning how to work this way inches us closer to achieving the two goals pursued by all mindful actors: being in the moment; reacting to the moment. In sum, SDS is about bridging nature-based science and imagination-based art. It's about fusing gravity-dictated anatomical fact and non-rationally appetite-driven emotion to help both the actor and person in you play a text's action with greater looseness, greater power, and greater believability."}]}, {"id": "15317", "termId": "4760", "schoolId": "SoC", "subjectId": "THEATRE", "courseId": "373-1", "name": "Acting II: Analysis and Performance", "sectionNumber": "20", "instructors": ["David S Catlin"], "topic": "Greek Tragedy", "schedules": [{"dow": ["Mo", "We"], "start": {"hour": 13, "minute": 0}, "end": {"hour": 14, "minute": 50}, "location": "Wirtz 101 Performnce Black Box"}], "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of Class", "value": "Contact the department for further information"}]}, {"id": "15318", "termId": "4760", "schoolId": "SoC", "subjectId": "THEATRE", "courseId": "373-1", "name": "Acting II: Analysis and Performance", "sectionNumber": "21", "instructors": ["Shawn T Douglass"], "topic": "Greek Tragedy", "schedules": [{"dow": ["Mo", "We"], "start": {"hour": 9, "minute": 0}, "end": {"hour": 10, "minute": 50}, "location": "Wirtz Center STRUB"}], "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of Class", "value": "Contact the department for further information"}]}, {"id": "15319", "termId": "4760", "schoolId": "SoC", "subjectId": "THEATRE", "courseId": "373-1", "name": "Acting II: Analysis and Performance", "sectionNumber": "22", "instructors": ["Cynthia Lynn   Gold"], "topic": "Greek Tragedy", "schedules": [{"dow": ["Mo", "We"], "start": {"hour": 13, "minute": 0}, "end": {"hour": 14, "minute": 50}, "location": "Wirtz Center WALLIS"}], "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of Class", "value": "Contact the department for further information"}]}, {"id": "15320", "termId": "4760", "schoolId": "SoC", "subjectId": "THEATRE", "courseId": "373-1", "name": "Acting II: Analysis and Performance", "sectionNumber": "23", "instructors": ["John Thomas Rapley"], "topic": "Greek Tragedy", "schedules": [{"dow": ["Mo", "We"], "start": {"hour": 13, "minute": 0}, "end": {"hour": 14, "minute": 50}, "location": "Wirtz Center SOUTH"}], "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of Class", "value": "Contact the department for further information"}]}, {"id": "15321", "termId": "4760", "schoolId": "SoC", "subjectId": "THEATRE", "courseId": "373-1", "name": "Acting II: Analysis and Performance", "sectionNumber": "24", "instructors": ["Gail S Shapiro"], "topic": "Greek Tragedy", "schedules": [{"dow": ["Tu", "Th"], "start": {"hour": 9, "minute": 0}, "end": {"hour": 10, "minute": 50}, "location": "Wirtz Center WALLIS"}], "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of Class", "value": "Contact the department for further information"}]}, {"id": "15313", "termId": "4760", "schoolId": "SoC", "subjectId": "THEATRE", "courseId": "375-0", "name": "Advanced Acting Topics", "sectionNumber": "21", "instructors": ["Henry Dominic Godinez"], "topic": "Latinx Theatre", "schedules": [{"dow": ["Mo", "We"], "start": {"hour": 15, "minute": 0}, "end": {"hour": 16, "minute": 50}, "location": "Wirtz 225 Instruct Black Box 2"}], "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "The Latinx Theatre Special Topics class is a hybrid scene study-history/lit/crit course designed to explore the richness of contemporary Latinx theatre in the United States.

Considerable attention will be devoted to specific steps within the design and implementation process, as well as case studies of actual programs. We will examine a range of topics, including: finding inspiration; identification, recruitment, and retention of target audiences; staff selection; setting global and incremental goals; and ensuring sustainability. We must also acknowledge that what counts as a social need or social problem is subjective and complex and that programs can therefore be controversial, difficult to manage, and difficult to evaluate.

From a policy perspective, human trafficking is difficult to address because the entire practice is illicit, and as a result, hidden. Further, trafficking often victimizes individuals who are already vulnerable due to poverty, immigration status, age, domestic abuse, and/or drug abuse, which means anti-trafficking policy often overlaps with many other policy spheres including immigration, security, environmental policy, sex industry policies, and health policy. We will examine the context of modern slavery against a backdrop of colonialism and slavery to understand key features of modern slavery, both as the crime is perpetuated and variations in legal definitions.

It seems as if everyone is a blogger these days. Part column, part personal essay, part aggregator and part disseminator of news and information?blogs are clearly influencing public discourse and commerce. But they run the gamut from great to, well, you know the flipside. Part of this disparity stems from the fact that blogs are like the Wild West?there are no hard and fast rules governing the blogosphere.<br/><br/>But, reminiscent of a judge's famous words, \"You'll know a good blog when you see it.\" Or at least you will by the end of this course, which will explore the elements that make a blog engaging to readers. You'll examine different blog formats, hear from real bloggers and learn how to be a blogger yourself. You'll choose a topic or theme you're passionate about and experiment for the next 10 weeks writing different kinds of blogs on that subject.<br/><br/>The internet is a busy place, so to capture audience attention amid all the noise and chatter, we start from the premise, \"Content is king.\" The course will focus on good writing techniques?clarity, brevity, strong verbs and vivid details?and give students plenty of practice writing and rewriting. Be prepared to sharpen your research skills, too. Your blogs should be rooted in real observations and facts, linking to sources when possible. Over the quarter, you'll have an opportunity to hone your blog writing skills, find your own voice and connect with a target audience on a specific subject area. In the end, my hope is that you will leave the course as a prolific blogger with an online series that reflects your own personal \"brand\" and attracts hordes of followers. <br/><br/>Previous journalism or HTML coding experience is not required."}]}, {"id": "18043", "termId": "4760", "schoolId": "SCS", "subjectId": "LEADERS", "courseId": "481-DL", "name": "Foundations of Leadership", "sectionNumber": "55", "instructors": ["Russell Leo Roberson"], "topic": "", "schedules": [{"dow": ["Mo"], "start": {"hour": 19, "minute": 0}, "end": {"hour": 21, "minute": 30}, "location": "TBA"}], "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of Class", "value": "Contact the department for further information"}]}, {"id": "18044", "termId": "4760", "schoolId": "SCS", "subjectId": "LEADERS", "courseId": "481-DL", "name": "Foundations of Leadership", "sectionNumber": "57", "instructors": ["Mark   Clare"], "topic": "", "schedules": [{"dow": ["Tu"], "start": {"hour": 19, "minute": 0}, "end": {"hour": 21, "minute": 30}, "location": "TBA"}], "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of Class", "value": "Contact the department for further information"}]}, {"id": "18242", "termId": "4760", "schoolId": "SCS", "subjectId": "LEAD_ART", "courseId": "202-0", "name": "Leaders as Change Agents", "sectionNumber": "43", "instructors": ["Carlann Ruth Fergusson"], "topic": "", "schedules": [{"dow": ["Tu", "We"], "start": {"hour": 9, "minute": 0}, "end": {"hour": 17, "minute": 0}, "location": "Wieboldt Hall 406"}], "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of Class", "value": "Contact the department for further information"}]}, {"id": "18282", "termId": "4760", "schoolId": "SCS", "subjectId": "LEAD_ART", "courseId": "204-0", "name": "Developing People and Teams", "sectionNumber": "42", "instructors": ["Alyssa Faith Dickman"], "topic": "", "schedules": [{"dow": ["Mo", "Tu"], "start": {"hour": 9, "minute": 0}, "end": {"hour": 17, "minute": 0}, "location": "Wieboldt Hall 711"}], "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of Class", "value": "Contact the department for further information"}]}, {"id": "18297", "termId": "4760", "schoolId": "SCS", "subjectId": "LIT", "courseId": "410-DL", "name": "Introduction to Graduate Studies in Literary and Cultural Analysis", "sectionNumber": "55", "instructors": ["Caitlyn Patricia   Doyle"], "topic": "", "schedules": [{"dow": ["We"], "start": {"hour": 19, "minute": 0}, "end": {"hour": 21, "minute": 30}, "location": "TBA"}], "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of Class", "value": "Contact the department for further information"}]}, {"id": "18045", "termId": "4760", "schoolId": "SCS", "subjectId": "LIT", "courseId": "492-0", "name": "Special Topics", "sectionNumber": "50", "instructors": ["Helen F Thompson"], "topic": "Women, Speculative Fiction, and Dystopia", "schedules": [{"dow": ["Mo"], "start": {"hour": 19, "minute": 0}, "end": {"hour": 21, "minute": 30}, "location": "Wieboldt Hall 511"}], "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of Class", "value": "Contact the department for further information"}]}, {"id": "18160", "termId": "4760", "schoolId": "SCS", "subjectId": "MATH", "courseId": "101-CN", "name": "Algebra", "sectionNumber": "65", "instructors": ["Rodolfo   Maglio"], "topic": "", "schedules": [{"dow": ["We"], "start": {"hour": 18, "minute": 15}, "end": {"hour": 21, "minute": 15}, "location": "Lunt Hall 107"}], "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "This course is intended to provide basic Algebra review and introduction to fundamental mathematical models of graphs, linear, quadratic, polynomials, rational, exponential, and logarithmic functions, system of equations and matrices.<br/><br/>Recommended for students who would benefit from reviewing high school algebra.

By learning about past cultures, what made them different and what made them similar, we gain a better understanding of human history and the state of the world today. People in the past were very different, but they shared one thing in common - they left behind stones and bones, pottery fragments, great monuments and burial offerings. These fragments of the past are used by archaeologists to build an understanding of what it means to be human. In this class, you will be introduced to the questions, theories, and methods of archaeology. You will learn about how archaeologists locate, survey and excavate the great monuments of the past; how they study artifacts in the lab; and how they use the stuff they find to piece together stories about the past, and test those stories against the evidence.

Conversely, what happens when reproduction fails to occur, or does so when and how it should not. Because reproduction is so strongly associated with biology in our society, viewing it through a cultural lens poses significant challenges to some of our most basic tenets. Tensions arise in questions of agency vs. control, nature vs. culture, identity construction, reproducing under varying conditions, and so on. The study of reproduction, therefore, offers a window into the heart of anthropology itself.

The biggest of these movie stars in India, and probably in the world, is Amitabh Bachchan. With his brooding, rebellious charisma, not to mention his ready wit and enviable dance moves, his \"angry young man\" persona dominated the films of the 1970s. Today, half a century after his film debut, he is still a major star. His face and voice are instantly recognizable, not only throughout South Asia and its diaspora, but in Africa, the Middle East, and elsewhere. As his characters have aged from youthful rebels to somewhat less youthful rebels to stern patriarchs to goofy old men obsessed with their digestive tracts, he has at times seemed inescapable off the movie screen as well. He has spent time in politics, hosted a wildly successful game show, and starred in children's comic books; one fan has even built a temple to worship him as a literal idol.

Evolution occurs when mutation introduces new alleles that replace existing alleles in populations via one of two mechanisms. Replacement can occur by chance (genetic drift) or by encoding a superior phenotype (natural selection). Natural selection produces one of the major features of the living world, adaptation. We will model these processes for single-locus traits, DNA sequences, and phenotypic traits. When populations are separated from one another geographically, they inevitably take different evolutionary paths; it is in this manner that most species are formed. These latter processes-change within lineages and diversification among lineages-have been iterated over staggeringly long periods of time, producing another major feature of the living world, its breathtaking biodiversity.

The class is composed of 25 students who are split into teams of five, and matched with local non-profit organizations and Kellogg MBA mentors, to work on quarter-long consulting engagements. Students directly engage with their client organizations in the field and then collectively meet once per week to discuss issues and problems they are facing with one another and their instructor, as well as to attend a series of classroom lectures on the nonprofit sector. To inform and guide students' interactions with non-profits, the classroom sessions will provide an overview of the non-profit sector and the growing trends towards greater accountability, transparency and performance management. Students will explore the changing roles and responsibilities of non-profits, as shaped by both the public and private sector, and they will examine the implications of these trends. The course curriculum has two parts: 1) introducing students to the so-called Third Sector and the present political and economic systems that influence how it serves the public good and 2) examining business strategy and management and their applicability to non-profits.

From reflections of ancient Rome in Star Wars to the adaptation of Greek comedy in Spike Lee's Chiraq, we will examine not just how antiquity perseveres in American culture, but how popular art creatively and critically engages with inherited Classical traditions. We will also consider engagement with Classical antiquity in some non-cinematic media as well, such as the graphic novel and even the architecture of the city of Chicago.

This course addresses the question of survival through contemporary films that reflect upon the authoritarian regimes in Brazil (1964-85), Chile (1973-90), and Argentina (1976-83). Together, we will explore documentary and feature films that grapple with the effects that these regimes had?and continue to have?on society, politics, and international relations.

Arendt's next major work, The Human Condition, thus moves toward an analysis of the conditions and modes of human activity: from the biological life process, to the world-creating capacity of homo faber, to the urgency and fragility of human action. As we read The Human Condition, which seeks to answer the question posed by the Origins by accounting for what European philosophy has generally failed to analyze with sufficient clarity?namely, the dimensions of the \"active life\"?we examine Arendt's attempt in the same period to review and, in her own way, deconstruct the concepts of thinking around which the ideal of a \"contemplative life\" concretized. This prepares us for a reading in the final weeks of the seminar of Eichmann in Jerusalem, where she re-conceptualizes evil as a certain implementation of systematic thoughtlessness. As we examine these three major works, each of which is a reflection on the relation between language and politics, we will continually attend to the varying ways in which Arendt sought to understand where poetry stands in relation to human \"conditionality,\" and we will use her often-neglected suggestions in this regard to develop an Arendtian poetics."}]}, {"id": "17279", "termId": "4760", "schoolId": "WCAS", "subjectId": "COMP_LIT", "courseId": "413-0", "name": "Comparative Studies in Theme", "sectionNumber": "20", "instructors": ["Rajeev Kumar Kinra"], "topic": "Orientalism and Its Discontents", "schedules": [{"dow": ["Tu"], "start": {"hour": 9, "minute": 0}, "end": {"hour": 11, "minute": 50}, "location": "Harris Hall L40"}], "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "Edward Said's \"Orientalism\" (1978) has been one of the most influential - and controversial - works of scholarship of the last half century.

We will use economic theory and landmark legal cases to study the purpose and development of antitrust law, which is meant to reduce the adverse effects of anti-competitive business practices. Next, large fixed costs of building and maintaining a physical network may generate natural monopolies in markets for electric power, cable television, natural gas, and water. We will explore the challenges regulators face when they attempt to apply market controls such as price caps so an essential service remains affordable. We will also ponder the proper role of government in today's digital economy, which features a number of winner-take-all markets, in which bandwagon effects result in convergence to a single operating system, recording technology, or social network. Finally, society might be willing to trade short-term welfare loss for long-term gains by granting temporary monopolies (e.g., patents or copyrights) to provide an incentive to innovate.

We will read a wide collection of such essays to hone your skills in close reading and sophisticated comprehension.<br/><br/>For comparison and contrast, across the disciplines we will also read material considered to be for the \"general public\" (such as The New York Times, The Economist, Vanity Fair). What is gained and what is lost when a complicated topic is \"translated\" from \"academic speak\" to \"plain prose\"? In many classes you will also engage with primary materials: novels, The Constitution, survey data, a burial mound, and so we will as well in this seminar. <br/><br/>In reading and evaluating all these kinds materials in any class you will need to up your game as you start Northwestern. The goal of this course is to hone your skills in close reading. But what does getting better at \"close reading\" mean? It means: always understanding new vocabulary; reading carefully at the level of the sentence; tracing the argument through the sequence of paragraphs; identifying the evidence - or lack of evidence - so central to any successful argument in all fields; being able to paraphrase the main thrust of the argument. <br/><br/>This kind of reading enables sophisticated analysis and critique, which is the goal for your writing for the class as well as your contribution to class discussion. As your close reading skills become more advanced, your participation in discussions and your own critical analysis in writing will also advance in sophistication. <br/><br/>We will read across the social science and humanities fields taught at Northwestern, including a number of essays by eminent Northwestern scholars. I have not finalized our selection, but we will read about such things as data and skepticism about data; literature and literary theory; history and the revision of historical truisms; the intersectional categories of race, gender and class?

This class will consider Jane Austen's development as a writer, in the context of the \"culture wars\" in Britain in the 1790s, in the wake of the French Revolution. Is Austen a radical or conservative novelist? Does she defend the values of a dying aristocracy, or champion a new middle class sensibility? How does she respond to the jarring changes affecting her society? Does she assert the privileges of the governing classes or urge the rights of silenced groups (especially young women)? Does she offer a traditional or progressive view of marriage? Should children make their own choices in marriage or defer to parental authority? How do her novels cultivate good judgment? Do the arts have a progressive role in transforming society or a conservative one in maintaining traditional values? These are some of the questions we will examine as we read a range of her novels. Our goal will be to understand the experimental and fluid nature of Austen's thought, as well as the way in which she transformed the history of the novel.<br/><br/>One important purpose of the class will be to develop skills of critical thinking and analytic writing. To that end, we will practice dissecting the arguments of others, work on formulating and defending our own arguments in writing, and hone the skills of listening to other positions in classroom conversation and debate.

In this seminar we'll examine some of them by looking at four canonical writers: the Pearl Poet, William Langland (a nom de plume), John Gower (ca. 1330-1408), and Geoffrey Chaucer (1343-1400). As for the Pearl Poet, not only his name but also his dates and patronage remain obscure. Yet he exercised considerable control over the manuscript production of his works, which include Pearl and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. Langland, the author of Piers Plowman, was a member of the gentry class, using a pen name for political reasons. Having devoted his entire career to successive revisions of a single masterpiece, he invites us to think about the reasons a controversial author might choose anonymity, as well as the difficulty of supporting oneself by writing and the significant roles of scribes. Gower and Chaucer, who were friends, nevertheless had very different career paths. Gower enables us to reflect on a writer's choice of languages: he penned his three major poems first in French, then in Latin, finally in English. The civil servant Chaucer, displaying the greatest authorial self-awareness in the period, also allows us to consider the choice of audience. After a political and personal crisis, he deliberately turned from court patronage to produce the closest thing we have to a work \"for the general public,\" namely The Canterbury Tales. We will read all four poets selectively, along with critical and theoretical work on manuscripts, scribal culture, professional readers, underemployed clerics, multilingualism, and gendered readership."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Permission of department required"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "The Complete Works of the Pearl Poet, ed.

In the period, the crisis plays itself out in the discourses of empiricism, aesthetics and the novel, as it does today in humanistic interpretation, political theory and the implementation of scientific research to improve our lives. This class will explore the many dimensions of the crisis of judgment in the eighteenth century, with particular attention to the role of fiction in the crisis. Fictions are essential to enable judgment, whether in the perception of three-dimensional objects, the discernment of character or the discovery of purpose in a world stripped of ends. But at the same time, a worry emerges in a number of discourses that fiction corrupts our judgment or leads it astray. Attempts are made to purge judgment of its fictive underpinnings. How do we make sense of these contradictory impulses, and what effects do they have on the prevailing accounts of judgment? Why are fictions perceived to be so threatening to our capacity for judgment? How effective are the efforts to conceal the role of fiction in judgment? Can we admit the agency of fiction in judgment without conceding that judgment is always errant or deceived? In particular, how does the emergence of the novel as a form in the eighteenth century (the rise of the novel) respond to the crisis?<br/><br/>In this class, we will explore the problem from many angles, including accounts of perception and experience in empiricism and the novel (Aristotle, Locke, Sterne, Benjamin), aesthetic discourse as an attempt to restore final causes in the wake of empiricism (Shaftesbury, Addison and Steele, Kant), the prevalence of Quixotic narratives in the early novel (Don Quixote, Joseph Andrews, Tristram Shandy, Female Quixote, Emma) and the discernment of novelistic character (Joseph Andrews, Tristram Shandy, Pride and Prejudice). Alongside this literature from the period, we will read secondary criticism on the rise of the novel (Georg Lukacs, Ian Watt, Michael McKeon), secularization (Charles Taylor, Alasdair MacIntyre, Thomas Pfau, Iris Murdoch), final causes (Aristotle and the new science), and the status of fiction in the period (Luiz Costa Lima, John Bender, Helen Thompson).

Arendt's next major work, The Human Condition, thus moves toward an analysis of the conditions and modes of human activity: from the biological life process, to the world-creating capacity of homo faber, to the urgency and fragility of human action. As we read The Human Condition, which seeks to answer the question posed by the Origins by accounting for what European philosophy has generally failed to analyze with sufficient clarity?namely, the dimensions of the \"active life\"?we examine Arendt's attempt in the same period to review and, in her own way, deconstruct the concepts of thinking around which the ideal of a \"contemplative life\" concretized. This prepares us for a reading in the final weeks of the seminar of Eichmann in Jerusalem, where she re-conceptualizes evil as a certain implementation of systematic thoughtlessness. As we examine these three major works, each of which is a reflection on the relation between language and politics, we will continually attend to the varying ways in which Arendt sought to understand where poetry stands in relation to human \"conditionality,\" and we will use her often-neglected suggestions in this regard to develop an Arendtian poetics."}]}, {"id": "10446", "termId": "4760", "schoolId": "WCAS", "subjectId": "ENGLISH", "courseId": "490-0", "name": "Independent Reading", "sectionNumber": "20", "instructors": ["Julia Ann   Stern"], "topic": "", "schedules": [{"dow": "TBA", "start": "TBA", "end": "TBA", "location": "TBA"}], "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of Class", "value": "Contact the department for further information"}]}, {"id": "17339", "termId": "4760", "schoolId": "WCAS", "subjectId": "ENGLISH", "courseId": "490-0", "name": "Independent Reading", "sectionNumber": "21", "instructors": ["William Reginald   Gibbons Jr"], "topic": "", "schedules": [{"dow": "TBA", "start": "TBA", "end": "TBA", "location": "TBA"}], "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of Class", "value": "Contact the department for further information"}]}, {"id": "10469", "termId": "4760", "schoolId": "WCAS", "subjectId": "ENGLISH", "courseId": "493-0", "name": "Elements of Craft", "sectionNumber": "20", "instructors": ["Juan M Martinez"], "topic": "", "schedules": [{"dow": ["Mo"], "start": {"hour": 10, "minute": 0}, "end": {"hour": 13, "minute": 0}, "location": "University Hall 018 English"}], "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "We can safely assume a familiarity with most aspects of craft.

For the first three weeks of the class, we will read the three sections of the Origins along with a selection of Arendt's contemporaneous writings on issues at the heart of her study: wide-scale statelessness and forced migration; racism and imperial expansion; totalitarian propaganda and the \"holes of oblivion.\" Arendt recognized that the Origins posed a question that remained unanswered in that work: faced with the manufacture of living corpses, what preserves our humanity and redeems our actions? Arendt's next major work, The Human Condition, thus moves toward an analysis of the conditions and modes of human activity: from the biological life process, to the world-creating capacity of homo faber, to the urgency and fragility of human action. As we read The Human Condition, which seeks to answer the question posed by the Origins by accounting for what European philosophy has generally failed to analyze with sufficient clarity?namely, the dimensions of the \"active life\"?we examine Arendt's attempt in the same period to review and, in her own way, deconstruct the concepts of thinking around which the ideal of a \"contemplative life\" concretized. This prepares us for a reading in the final weeks of the seminar of Eichmann in Jerusalem, where she re-conceptualizes evil as a certain implementation of systematic thoughtlessness. As we examine these three major works, each of which is a reflection on the relation between language and politics, we will continually attend to the varying ways in which Arendt sought to understand where poetry stands in relation to human \"conditionality,\" and we will use her often-neglected suggestions in this regard to develop an Arendtian poetics."}]}, {"id": "13150", "termId": "4760", "schoolId": "WCAS", "subjectId": "GERMAN", "courseId": "490-0", "name": "Independent Reading", "sectionNumber": "21", "instructors": ["Franziska B Lys"], "topic": "", "schedules": [{"dow": "TBA", "start": "TBA", "end": "TBA", "location": "TBA"}], "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of Class", "value": "Contact the department for further information"}]}, {"id": "13151", "termId": "4760", "schoolId": "WCAS", "subjectId": "GERMAN", "courseId": "490-0", "name": "Independent Reading", "sectionNumber": "22", "instructors": ["Jorg   Kreienbrock"], "topic": "", "schedules": [{"dow": "TBA", "start": "TBA", "end": "TBA", "location": "TBA"}], "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of Class", "value": "Contact the department for further information"}]}, {"id": "13152", "termId": "4760", "schoolId": "WCAS", "subjectId": "GERMAN", "courseId": "490-0", "name": "Independent Reading", "sectionNumber": "24", "instructors": ["Erica Suzanne Weitzman"], "topic": "", "schedules": [{"dow": "TBA", "start": "TBA", "end": "TBA", "location": "TBA"}], "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of Class", "value": "Contact the department for further information"}]}, {"id": "13153", "termId": "4760", "schoolId": "WCAS", "subjectId": "GERMAN", "courseId": "490-0", "name": "Independent Reading", "sectionNumber": "25", "instructors": ["Christine M Helmer"], "topic": "", "schedules": [{"dow": "TBA", "start": "TBA", "end": "TBA", "location": "TBA"}], "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of Class", "value": "Contact the department for further information"}]}, {"id": "13685", "termId": "4760", "schoolId": "WCAS", "subjectId": "GNDR_ST", "courseId": "101-6", "name": "First-Year Seminar", "sectionNumber": "20", "instructors": ["Amy Ruth Partridge"], "topic": "Our Bodies Ourselves: The Women's Health Movement", "schedules": [{"dow": ["Tu", "Th"], "start": {"hour": 14, "minute": 0}, "end": {"hour": 15, "minute": 20}, "location": "Locy Hall 314"}], "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "The U.S. 1970s Women's Health Movement demanded everything from safe birth control on demand to an end to for-profit healthcare.

Then, as now, groups with competing ideas about the healthcare needs of women as a group identified as part of same movement. Thus, an examination of historical and current debates over \"women's health\" is also a means of assessing several distinct, often competing, paradigms of health and disease.

In industrialized and post-industrial societies, women have increasingly taken up paid employment and moved into formerly-masculine fields, driven by demand for women workers as the economy shifts toward the service sector, and more recently by feminist movements. Yet women are still doing the majority of caring and household labor, while men's take-up of traditionally feminine caring labor has been far more limited. Moreover, the sex segregation of occupations and substantial gendered earnings gaps remain. Meanwhile, much of the work formerly done by housewives has been \"outsourced\" to paid service workers, many of whom migrate from global South to global North to take up this work. Scholars debate about whether and how these arrangements will change, and whether they may be influenced by political initiatives, either top-down (e.g., affirmative action to recruit women to STEM fields) or bottom-up (e.g., cultural and media campaigns to validate new norms). In this course, we will investigate the ways in which work - paid and unpaid, in families and in places of employment - is organized by gender and other forms of power, difference and inequality, such as race, class and migration/citizenship status. We will examine family divisions of labor across diverse households: how do men and women divide domestic work and care for children or others needing care? Where does non-familial provision come into play? What are the consequences for outcomes in paid employment and in terms of the distribution of time, respect, and power? We will learn about the development of the modern economy and occupational sex segregation, as well as how different kinds of men and women are treated at work.

Trials are also exceptionally revealing of the basic values in society. What distinguishes the great trials has been how they uncover conflicts about those values, how they preserve for prosperity a sensitivity for justice and injustice, how they symbolize conflicting values, and how often they have stimulated great works of philosophy and literature. In this course we shall analyze a few of the most famous trials from the ancient world to the twentieth-first century and ask such questions as what is justice and injustice, what is the role of persuasive rhetoric in trials, how have trials constructed evidence for and against defendants, and most importantly how have the trials of certain individuals stimulated a debate about the fundamental values of society?"}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "Write strong argumentative essays"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Discussion and papers"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Plato, The Trial of Socrates, Dover, Thrift Editions, ISBN 0-486-27066<br/>David Lagomarsino and Charles T.

City councils and state legislatures debated so-called \"bathroom bills,\" corporations and nongovernmental organizations severed ties with states in which such bills passed, and various religious denominations plans to expand in states that did not recognize trans rights, and nongovernmental organizations such as the NCAA mounted boycotts to protest the passage of anti-trans ordinances and legislation. During the Obama administration, the Justice, Education, and Defense Departments all issued sweeping commitments to trans equality; statements subsequently repudiated by President Trump and the heads of those same departments in his administration. This class asks \"why?\" and \"why then?\" What was and is at stake, and for whom?

Even though they were nominally under the authority of the Grand Rabbinate in the imperial center just like the other major confessional groups of the empire, like the Greek Orthodox, and the Armenians, the functioning of Jewish communities did not conform to a uniform pattern and was far more heterogeneous in practice. During the nineteenth century, as the Ottoman Empire was shaken up by the influence of nationalist movements on the one hand, and the conflicting agendas of the Great Powers on the other, its Jewish communities also had to devise strategies to deal with these forces and engage with the question of modernization. After the demise of the Ottoman Empire they found themselves separated by the boundaries of different nation-states.

"Topic: Atlantic Worlds<br/><br/>This topics seminar is for graduate students with research interests in the early modern Atlantic world, roughly spanning the sixteenth through the nineteenth centuries. A recent proliferation of edited volumes, special journal issues, dissertations, and historical monographs argue that the early modern Atlantic was overwhelmingly African, Iberian, or indigenous American, and in the process reorient the field away from its conventional northern Atlantic focus. What insights and analytical frameworks can scholars of Latin America, Africa, Europe, or the United States glean from this turn in Atlantic history, an inherently comparative, transnational, transcultural, and oceanic approach to the past? We will read an array of recent examples of this history, with an eye toward prevailing trends, methodologies, and topics; major schools of study; and ongoing debates about chronology, scope, and concepts, such as region, empire, nation, subject, citizen, slavery, feudalism, capitalism, commodity, ecosystem, and revolution."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Assessment will be based on two short review essays (15% each), class participation (40%), and a final written assignment (30%)"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Lauren Benton, Law and Colonial Cultures: Legal Regimes in World History (Cambridge, 2002)<br/>J.H.

In their works, many questioned the prevailing regime, which expected intellectuals to support the State. While the Tsars sought to place limits on Tolstoy, Pushkin, and others, their privileged place in society prevented the regime from massively repressing them and their works.<br/><br/>This all changed when Stalin came to the Kremlin. His regime expected the writer not just to enlighten the masses, but to mobilize them to accomplish the goals of the State. Using an extensive system of repression and rewards, the Stalinist regime either coopted writers, or silenced them altogether. Even after the death of Stalin, the regime forced writers either to put their talents at the service of the State, or to go underground. Nevertheless, starting during the \"Thaw\" in the sixties, the USSR saw the resurrection of the idea of the independent-minded writer as the conscience of society - but not without consequences to the writers themselves.

Even though they were nominally under the authority of the Grand Rabbinate in the imperial center just like the other major confessional groups of the empire, like the Greek Orthodox, and the Armenians, the functioning of Jewish communities did not conform to a uniform pattern and was far more heterogeneous in practice. During the nineteenth century, as the Ottoman Empire was shaken up by the influence of nationalist movements on the one hand, and the conflicting agendas of the Great Powers on the other, its Jewish communities also had to devise strategies to deal with these forces and engage with the question of modernization. After the demise of the Ottoman Empire they found themselves separated by the boundaries of different nation-states.

Students will consider how the academic context may vary across cultures, and become acquainted with American norms and expectations. They will develop key skills for academic interactions, such as making small talk, effective use of email, and formal/informal presentations. Along the way, students will learn about the sound structure of English as they work towards improved pronunciation and fluency. Students will have an opportunity to consider their own oral English proficiency in light of proficiency assessments used at Northwestern, and will receive feedback on Versant test performance and practice sessions."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Grant, Linda.

Even though they were nominally under the authority of the Grand Rabbinate in the imperial center just like the other major confessional groups of the empire, like the Greek Orthodox, and the Armenians, the functioning of Jewish communities did not conform to a uniform pattern and was far more heterogeneous in practice. During the nineteenth century, as the Ottoman Empire was shaken up by the influence of nationalist movements on the one hand, and the conflicting agendas of the Great Powers on the other, its Jewish communities also had to devise strategies to deal with these forces and engage with the question of modernization. After the demise of the Ottoman Empire they found themselves separated by the boundaries of different nation-states.

The classical writings of Peirce, James, Dewey set the stage for a completely new orientation in epistemology, moral and political theory, psychology and many other fields. Basic to all Pragmatist writers is the belief that the active and interactive human being in its natural and social environment has to stand at the center of reflection. They thus emphasize volitional, procedural, social, and evolutionary aspects of knowledge of any kind. Given this focus on practically involved intelligent agents, political pragmatists like Dewey, Addams, Locke explore the natural origins, revisability and legitimacy of moral and political norms. They develop the idea of a critical use of knowledge and its connection to non-violent democratic conduct. Neopragmatists (Rorty and Putnam) explore the philosophical and political implications of critical thinking."}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "1) Students will become competent in the basic texts in the pragmatist philosophical literature from Peirce to Putnam. 2) Students will acquire an enhanced sensitivity for method, logical analysis of theoretical and practical complexes and their connection, as well as an increased expertise in the close written and oral analysis of complex thoughts and textual sources. 3) One of the central aims will be, following the central topic of pragmatist thought, to offer students a complete reflective awareness of the structure of problem-solving behavior in cognitive, scientific, ethical and cultural affairs, and to train them in applying this competency to cases. 4) Students will acquire an awareness of the close connections between 'theoretical' positions and political conditions."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "One short paper (Midterm, ca. 1600 words), ca. 35% of final grade.

In part I we will focus on explaining the causes of war, and reflect on current security problems, particularly in terms of inter-state conflicts. In part II we turn to how we have moved from traditional inter-state relations to a globalized economic environment in which states, non-state actors, and international organizations interact. Part III discusses some global problems that we are facing and possible solutions.<br/><br/>More specifically the emphasis in part I will be on achieving a theoretical understanding of how one might explain the occurrence of war or peace. This course is not a discussion of current events, although they might be introduced to clarify particular perspectives. In other words, the emphasis is on developing a \"toolkit\" which you can use to understand international relations in general. The emphasis is not on memorizing details and empirical data, although of course you will need to understand key concepts and definitions. Instead you should ask yourself what caused war in this instance but not others? What are the underlying causes behind these observations?<br/><br/>Explanations of conflict occur at the individual level; at the state level; and at the level of the international system. We will use these different levels of analysis, or different images, to explain the outbreak of WW I. Analyzing this conflict will demonstrate the various approaches to understanding complex, macrohistorical phenomena in general. We will then apply some of these methodological insights to understand the absence of super power conflict during the Cold War, and to study security issues that have emerged since then.<br/><br/>In Part II we turn to global issues in the areas of international economic management (particularly trade). How did the post-war international economic order differ from the 1930s?

What compromises, if any, are appropriate when considering kleptocrats who are effectively holding their people hostage - for instance, rulers who systematically abuse loans from foreign creditors, but who rely on the fact that their vulnerable population will suffer if loans are cut off entirely? What compromises, if any, are morally appropriate when dealing with dictators who threaten to unleash violence unless they are guaranteed an amnesty by the democratic forces trying to replace them? <br/><br/>This upper-level course delves into such fraught political problems, revolving around different kinds of corruption and abuse of political power.

The second is the idea of the people as an agent with its own moral integrity - an integrity that might bear on intricate policy dilemmas surrounding the proper response to corruption.

This course reviews key political and anthropological theories<br/>of membership in political societies since antiquity to address foundational questions about political membership, such as: why do all political societies use birth (jus sanguinis or jus soli) as the paradigmatic decision rule for membership? What are the implications of this decision rule for attachments of nationality, ethnicity, race, and religion? What are the similarities and differences<br/>among these groups, heuristically and politically? What is the intellectual history of \"the nation\" and the claims that it is modern? Is the nation an inherently toxic form of membership that produces unjustified exclusions at best and genocide at worst? Or is there a form of national belonging that cultivates empathy and mutual care among economically and otherwise unequal members, such that the<br/>nation may and should be preserved but should be isolated from its adverse effects?

His regime expected the writer not just to enlighten the masses, but to mobilize them to accomplish the goals of the State. Using an extensive system of repression and rewards, the Stalinist regime either coopted writers, or silenced them altogether. Even after the death of Stalin, the regime forced writers either to put their talents at the service of the State, or to go underground. Nevertheless, starting during the \"Thaw\" in the sixties, the USSR saw the resurrection of the idea of the independent-minded writer as the conscience of society - but not without consequences to the writers themselves. They circulated hand-typed manuscripts (\"samizdat\"), or smuggled them for publication abroad (\"tamizdat\"). Repressive measures against dissident writers continued until the late eighties, when Gorbachev began to allow more free debate (\"glasnost\"). Finally, under Putin, repression returns, as the regime again instituted measures to reward those who support the State, and intimidate and even silence those who don't.<br/><br/>We will examine this relationship of the Russian writer to the State, and discuss how successive rulers have alternated between \"thaw\" and \"freeze,\" seeking to find what they saw as the proper balance in their efforts to ensure the survival of the regime."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lecture and discussion"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Grades will be based on class participation (30%), a midterm book review (20%), and a final paper (50%) discussing whether the Soviet political system could have survived, or whether Putin's regime could survive, without repressing free expression.

In industrialized and post-industrial societies, women have increasingly taken up paid employment and moved into formerly-masculine fields, driven by demand for women workers as the economy shifts toward the service sector, and more recently by feminist movements. Yet women are still doing the majority of caring and household labor, while men's take-up of traditionally feminine caring labor has been far more limited. Moreover, the sex segregation of occupations and substantial gendered earnings gaps remain. Meanwhile, much of the work formerly done by housewives has been \"outsourced\" to paid service workers, many of whom migrate from global South to global North to take up this work. Scholars debate about whether and how these arrangements will change, and whether they may be influenced by political initiatives, either top-down (e.g., affirmative action to recruit women to STEM fields) or bottom-up (e.g., cultural and media campaigns to validate new norms). In this course, we will investigate the ways in which work - paid and unpaid, in families and in places of employment - is organized by gender and other forms of power, difference and inequality, such as race, class and migration/citizenship status. We will examine family divisions of labor across diverse households: how do men and women divide domestic work and care for children or others needing care? Where does non-familial provision come into play? What are the consequences for outcomes in paid employment and in terms of the distribution of time, respect, and power? We will learn about the development of the modern economy and occupational sex segregation, as well as how different kinds of men and women are treated at work. Finally, we will consider the role of government policy in sustaining or changing these arrangements. By the end of the course, students should understand how gender influences the kinds of work we do and how it is rewarded, how gender interacts with other forms of difference and inequality, how the economy is organized along gendered lines, and how public policies and political processes shape the gendered world of work."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lecture and class discussion"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Take-home exams, blog entries, participation"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Andrea Doucet, Do Men Mother?
