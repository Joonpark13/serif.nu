What are the usual historical narratives about rock, and what myths do they perpetuate? What are rock's modes of production and consumption, of marketing, management, and labor? How is it connected to cultural identities along lines of race, gender, class, and sexuality?

The Expanding Republic - here we will explore how Americans transformed small colonies into the continental United States in the 19th Century and then fought a civil war over its future.3. The New Superpower - here we will explore how the United States recovered from civil war and turned a continental nation into the world's strongest superpower in the first half of the 20th Century.4. The Reformed Superpower - here we will explore how the United States fought the Cold War abroad and fought over the expansion of civil rights at home in the second half of the 20th Century. In each of these eras we will focus on one key question: what does it mean to be an American? Is American identity based on birthplace or geography residency? Or, is American-ness defined by a person's race or gender or ideological beliefs? And, who gets to decide? As we will see the definition of \"American\" and who gets to call themselves an \"American\" has changed overtime and been a constant source of conflict.</p>"}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "<ul><br/><li>Prerequisites: None</li><br/><li>Open to sophomores and above</li> <br/><li>Open for Cross-Registration</li><br/></ul>"}]}, {"id": "40764", "termId": "4750", "schoolId": "DOHA", "subjectId": "JOUR", "courseId": "390-0", "name": "Special Topics", "sectionNumber": "70", "instructors": ["Abraham Naseem Abusharif", "Zachary Valentine Wright"], "topic": "Islam, America, and the Media", "schedules": [{"dow": "TBA", "start": "TBA", "end": "TBA", "location": "Northwestern Qatar Room 2-255"}], "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "<p>This course will analyze how images of Islam are fashioned in the U.S. media in dialogue with (and/or ignorance of) the long history of Islam in America.

Commentary on A Brief Guide to U.S. Higher Education (6 pages): Formulate a critical response to A Brief Guide to U.S. Higher Education (2007), based on assigned readings, and course materials. In formulating your response, it is important to consider the implications of the institutional heterogeneity of higher education in the U.S., and how institutional contexts and missions shape administrative practice and leadership. You should consider media we have used in the class, including At Berkeley. Choose a topic you see described (or ignored) by A Brief Guide and critically analyze the significance of that topic in higher education administration today. Feel free to use the Chronicle Almanac as well as other texts from the class to construct your analysis. Outside materials that support your thesis can include appropriately cited works in the professional literature of higher education, examples of which are included at the end of the syllabus, as well as the Chronicle of Higher Education and other Higher Education news outlets.

Diversity in Higher Education Paper (10 pages): Using excerpts of Educating a Diverse Nation and Defending Diversity: Affirmative Action at the University of Michigan as starting points, critically consider the role of diversity in higher education in the twenty-first century. How have the arguments and perspectives on diversity developed in recent decades? How have and should issues of diversity evolve as we think about higher education in the heterogeneous future? Outside materials that support your thesis can include appropriately cited works in the professional literature of higher education, examples of which are included at the end of the syllabus, as well as the Chronicle of Higher Education and other Higher Education news outlets.

Final Case Study Paper (10 pages): Presentations will be made on Saturday, August 4 from 9am-4pm. Along with a group of your classmates, you will be tasked with \"thickly\" describing the character of an institution through a final paper and PowerPoint presentation. Based on the mission of the institution, choose topics for each group member to focus on that, when combined, will provide the class with a multi-dimensional analysis of the institution as a teaching, learning, service and/or research oriented community. Your final paper should only focus on the area for which you have taken responsibility within your case study team. When investigating the institution, make full use of appropriate periodical and research literature as well as materials included in the syllabus. Also use the institution's website, printed materials, interviews of administrators, faculty, students and/or alumni, and a visit to campus. Be attentive to formal and informal characteristics of institutional culture and patterns of operation and to the interactions between academic and administrative personnel. Be prepared to describe your research methodology. We suggest that the institutional analysis also take into consideration the issues of accessibility, affordability, and plans for outcomes assessment.

We will explore the challenges regulators face when they attempt to apply market controls such as price caps so an essential service remains affordable. We will also ponder the proper role of government in today's digital economy, which features a number of winner-take-all markets, in which bandwagon effects result in convergence to a single operating system, recording technology, or social network.

We'll ask if a camping trip can demonstrate the moral superiority of socialism. And we'll look at an analogical argument that bosses are like dictators and ask whether it is possible to justify the state's coercive power. In our final class we ask whether we can legitimately judge other people, societies, and cultures, or if instead truth is more relative.

We focus on several important questions about law including: How do culture, structure, and conflict explain the relationship between law and society? Why do people obey the law? Why do people go to court? How does the legal system work? What is the role of lawyers, judges, and juries? How does law on the books differ from law in action? How do social problems become legal ones? How can law create or constrain social change?"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Two response papers: 20% each<br/>Mi-term exam: 20% <br/>Final exam: 30%<br/>Attendance and participation: 10%"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Kitty Calavita, Invitation to Law and Society: An Introduction to the Study of Real Law, 2010, ISBN 978-0226296586<br/><br/>Other required readings will be on Canvas."}]}, {"id": "40386", "termId": "4750", "schoolId": "WCAS", "subjectId": "SOCIOL", "courseId": "226-0", "name": "Sociological Analysis", "sectionNumber": "26", "instructors": ["Joseph Michael Guisti"], "topic": "", "schedules": [{"dow": ["Tu", "Th"], "start": {"hour": 13, "minute": 0}, "end": {"hour": 15, "minute": 30}, "location": "Kresge Centennial Hall 2-343"}], "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "Social science research tries primarily to describe and explain how social processes result in differences between and within groups.

We will consider how to study different processes, how to accommodate ethical considerations, how to conduct data collection and analysis, and, how to communicate our findings. We will practice these different steps through three types of exercises. We will assess both popular media accounts of research and academic research articles with regard to validity, scope, and accuracy but also accessibility and persuasion. We will apply this knowledge by replicating the analyses of prior research projects (case materials will be provided) and, finally, we will design our own research protocols. This last exercise will be a quarter-long individual project that may take the form of a prospective proposal going from the collection of original data to the expected analysis or of an actual analysis based on publicly available data.

How has sexuality shaped political and economic processes? In what ways does sexuality intersect with gender, class, race/ethnicity, geographic location, and nationality? How is sexuality gendered and raced? The course will also consider how sexuality is related to different types of social inequalities.
