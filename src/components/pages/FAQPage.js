            Yes, and yes! Serif.nu is actively being updated to include new features to better serve
            the Northwestern student experience. You can expect course data to be updated regularly
            during registration season. If you&apos;re interested in the technical details of what

            I found a bug. What should I do?

          <Typography variant="body1">
            Please be aware that Serif.nu cannot guarantee the correctness of the data that we
            display. We simply use the course data that is available to us - we have no control
            over whether every single class time matches up with what is on CAESAR. Submissions
            such as &quot;Why don&apos;t I see SESP courses on Serif.nu?&quot; or &quot;The bio
            lab times are different than what&apos;s on CAESAR&quot; will be ignored.
