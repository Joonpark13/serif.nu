You can expect course data to be updated regularly during registration season. If you're interested in the technical details of what we're working on, check out our

        I found a bug. What should I do?

        Please be aware that Serif.nu cannot guarantee the correctness of the data that we display. We simply use the course data that is available to us - we have no control over whether every single class time matches up with what is on CAESAR. Submissions such as "Why don't I see SESP courses on Serif.nu?" or "The bio lab times are different than what's on CAESAR" will be ignored.
