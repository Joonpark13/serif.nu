## Repo Directory Structure

`/coverage` - auto generated by istanbul to contain test coverage information

`/docs` - contains various documentation files

`/node_modules` - this is where npm installs all of our dependency packages

`/public` - this is where we put the static files that we want served to the actual web. They'll get compiled into our build.

`/src` - this is where our source code for the app itself lives.

`/src/actions` - the Redux action type constants and the action creators live here.

`/src/components` - all of our React components live here.

`/src/data` - our JSON course data lives here.

`/src/effects` - all of our side effect functions live here.

`/src/images` - self explanatory

`/src/reducers` - our Redux reducers live here.

`/src/selectors` - our Redux selectors live here.

`/src/util` - any helper/utility functions live here.

`/package.json` - very important file! Contains basic information about our app such as its name, and lists out all of our app's dependencies. This is what allows npm to install the development environment correctly whenever someone pulls down a fresh clone of the repo.
