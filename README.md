## End of Life

Serif.nu is being sunset as of Fall 2020 (after uploading Spring 2020 data, no further course data updates will be pushed).

## About
Serif.nu is a course scheduler for Northwestern University that allows students to quickly and easily visualize their schedules before registering for courses. No more drawing it out on paper, no more clunky spreadsheets. Draft up a dream schedule (or four) before you open CAESAR.
