# Serif.nu
#### Simple. Fast. Visual. Course Planning for Northwestern University.

## About
Serif.nu is a course scheduler for Northwestern University aimed to allow students to quickly and easily visualize their schedules before registering for courses. No more drawing it out on paper, no more clunky spreadsheets. Draft up a dream schedule (or four) before you open CAESAR.

## History
Serif.nu began as a simple project that was mainly an excuse to teach [myself](http://joonpark.me/) JavaScript during my Sophomore year of college. I was surprised that Northwestern didn't already have a widely used application that allowed students to plan their course schedules before registration, and this sounded like the perfect reason to learn web development. [The first version](https://github.com/Joonpark13/nuvsc) of Serif.nu was hacked together with JS, jQuery, and PostgreSQL as I learned on the fly. I never intended the project to see the light of day, but after a few friends got a look at it, their enthusiam and desire to use it pushed me to polish it and put a version up online. I was delighted to find that many students found it useful.

After hearing how many students actually used the application to help them register for courses, I decided that I could build something better using a more modern web stack. So, I taught myself React and built [the second version](https://github.com/Joonpark13/serif.nu-old) from the ground up. This is the current version that is up on [https://serif.nu](https://serif.nu).

Upon graduating from Northwestern, I wanted Serif.nu to be maintained even after I'd left school. A group of Northwestern students and I are currently rebuilding the third version (this repository) in order to foster a group of student developers who are more familiar with the codebase and can continue maintaining the site after I move on.
