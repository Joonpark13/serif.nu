## About
Serif.nu is a course scheduler for Northwestern University that allows students to quickly and easily visualize their schedules before registering for courses. No more drawing it out on paper, no more clunky spreadsheets. Draft up a dream schedule (or four) before you open CAESAR.

Build with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), designed with [material-ui](https://material-ui.com/), tested with [jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/).

1st Place Winner of the 2017 [Northwestern IEEE](http://ieee.northwestern.edu/) Project Showcase
